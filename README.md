## Technical Implementation
# Technology Stack
*Frontend Architecture*

React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
Vite as build tool for optimized development and production builds
Tailwind CSS 4 for utility-first responsive styling
Lucide React for consistent iconography
Modern CSS with Google Fonts integration

*Backend Infrastructure*

Node.js with Express.js for API server implementation
TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
PDFKit for server-side PDF generation
CORS-enabled API architecture for cross-origin requests
Environment-based configuration management

*AI Integration*

Google Gemini AI API for intelligent proposal generation
